# Test Branch Directory Structure

This directory mirrors the folder names tracked on the `main` branch so that test workflows can reference the same subsystem layout:

- `Firmware/`
- `Other/`
- `Primary Documents/`
- `eCAD_Flight_Controller/`
- `eCAD_Power_System_Architecture/`
- `eCAD_RF_Transceivers/`
- `eCAD_Remote_Controller/`
- `mCAD/`

Each folder currently contains a `.gitkeep` placeholder and is ready for population with branch-specific validation artifacts.
